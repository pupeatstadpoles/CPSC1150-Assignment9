0. Define variables
0.1 input is a scanner object
0.2 num is an integer
0.3 valid is a boolean

1. START
2. Set valid to TRUE
3. Print: "This program converts integers from 0-3999 to their Roman numeral equivalent. Please enter in a number.
"
4. Repeat while valid is TRUE:
	4.1 num <-- user input integer
	4.2 Check for validity
		4.2.1 If 0<num<4000, set valid to FALSE
		4.2.2 Otherwise keep valid as TRUE
5. Convert to roman numeral:
	5.1 Get thousands value by doing num mod 1000
	5.2 Print "M" for 1000, "MM" for 2000, "MMM" for 3000
	5.3 Get hundreds value by doing (num mod 1000), then divide by 100.
	5.4 Print "C" for 100, "CC" for 200, "CCC" for 300, "CD" for 400,  "D" for 500, "DC" for 600, "DCC" for 700, "DCCC" for 800, "CM" for 900
	5.5 Get tens value by doing (num mod 100), then divide by 10.
	5.6 Print "X" for 10, "XX" for 20, "XXX" for 30, "XL" for 40, "L" for 50, "LX" for 60, "LXX" for 70, "LXXX" for 80, "XC" for 90
	5.7 Get ones value by doing num mod 10
	5.8 Print "I" for 1, "II" for 2, "III" for 3, "IV" for 4, "V" for 5, "VI" for 6, "VII" for 7, "VIII" for 8, "IX" for 9
